# MegaOpenWorld2D
2D game in python, open-source, for everybody


## The concept
It is to make a game were everybody brings something in it to make it the **WILDEST** top down 2d game none rng of all time.
In 2D to make it easy for everybody (little skill & low spec pc) to expand on it --> using Tiled for the maps and Krita for the designs

There is need for more precision on the idea but the ultimate goal is community creating a great game **TOGETHER**
